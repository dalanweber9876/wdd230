            <p class="text">
                Hick's Law is the idea that the more choices you give a user, the longer it will take them to choose. 
                The Glitch homscreen exemplifies this design principle by giving the user three distinct and different
                options. They can either create a basic website, create a links page, or create a blog. These limited
                options help the user to quickly reach a decision on what they want to do.

            <h2 class = "cardname">Visual Hierarchy</h2>

            <div>
            <h3>La Casa Del Zorro</h3>
            <a href = "https://www.lacasadelzorro.com/">lacasadelzorro.com</a>
            </div>

            <div>
            <img class = "visualhierarchyimg" src = "images/lacasadelzorroimg.PNG" alt = "Image of the La Casa Del Zorro homescreen.">
            </div>

            <p class="text">
                Visual Hierarchy is the practice of making the most important things more visible so that people
                naturally read it first. In this case, the first thing that I read was "Your oasis. Total relaxation.
                At the doorstep of California's largest State Park." Someone that would come to this website is looking
                for a great place to stay where they can relax and take a load off, thus this would be one of the most
                important parts. After reading that, the next thing I read is the book now, making the website very 
                easy to navigate.

            <div>

            <img class = "ruleofthirdsimg" src = "images/amazonimg.PNG" alt = "Image of the Amazon homescreen.">
            </div>

            <p class="text">
                Amazon is very good at using rule of thirds. If you look through their photos, many follow this rule.
                In this picture, if you draw a tic tac toe sign over the picture, you can see that the remote falls 
                perfectly on the right line, and the stick follows the bottom line where they both meet on that intersection.
