    <h2>Color Schema</h2>
    <img alt="Color Palette" src="images/colorpalette.png">
    <p>I will use Cerulean on the header/navigation bar and the footer. I will use Verdigris as a background color for my section headers. I will use Gunmetal if I feel like the Chamber website could use more/different colors.</p>
    
    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>I plan on using "Playfair" font for all of the text in the Rexburg Chamber of Commerce website (Currently in use).</p>
